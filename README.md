## Custom Image Rating - React Component


### Who?

You still wanted more after [LX Issue](https://github.com/liberty-x/lxissue) didn't you?

From the same team who brought you such hits as LX News :newspaper:, LX Search :mag: and the infamous LX Riddle :question: Liberty-X, a team in the 6th iteration of the Founders & Coders academy, brings you Custom Image Rating (React Component).

Our unchanged lineup is formed of members [Justen Barget](https://github.com/Jbarget), [Rachel Black](https://github.com/RachelBLondon), [Huw Davies](https://github.com/hdrdavies) and [Ruth Uwemedimo](https://github.com/rug1). :two_women_holding_hands::two_men_holding_hands:


### What?

This week we will aim to make a React component that we hope to publish via npm.
The component will be a customisable rating system that can be used in a variety of situations.
Where the fraction ("x out of y" or "x/y") is represented by "x" number of custom pictures.

### How?

We will be using React to create the component and using the "props" to set the outcome of the image.
eg. {fieldName: "HTML", max-rating: 5, rating: 4, image: http://img-src}
